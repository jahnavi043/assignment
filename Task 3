1. Distribute Leads Evenly Among Sales Reps
Objective: Assign leads automatically to sales reps in a round-robin manner using Google Sheets.

Implementation Steps:

Set Up Sales Rep Rotation in Google Sheets:

Add a column named "Assigned Sales Rep".
Create a list of sales reps (e.g., John, Sarah, and Alex).
Use Zapier to track assignments and rotate through the list.
Zapier Workflow:

Step 1: Trigger: Google Forms → New Response in Spreadsheet.
Step 2: Action: Use Formatter by Zapier → Numbers → Increment a counter.
Store this counter in a separate Google Sheets file or a Zapier storage key.
Step 3: Assign Rep:
Use a “Lookup Table” in Zapier Formatter to rotate reps based on the counter value:
1 → John, 2 → Sarah, 3 → Alex, then loop back to 1.
Update the "Assigned Sales Rep" column in the lead's row.
Limitations:

Zapier’s free plan allows a limited number of storage keys, so using Google Sheets for tracking might be better for scalability.
Manual updates to the sales rep list are needed if the team changes.
2. Extract Keywords from the "Comments" Field
Objective: Perform basic text analysis on the "Comments" field to categorize leads.

Implementation Steps:

Zapier Workflow:
Step 1: Trigger: Google Forms → New Response in Spreadsheet.
Step 2: Action: Use Formatter by Zapier → Text → Extract Keywords.
Example: Extract keywords like “demo,” “pricing,” “support,” or “urgent” from the "Comments" field.
Step 3: Categorize Lead:
Use a Zapier Filter to tag leads based on keywords:
“Demo” → Tag as “Interested in Product Demo.”
“Urgent” → Tag as “High Priority.”
Update the "Category" column in Google Sheets with these tags.
Limitations:

Zapier’s text extraction is basic and might not handle complex or ambiguous comments well. For more advanced analysis, tools like OpenAI’s API (paid) could be integrated.
3. Schedule Follow-Up Reminders for Sales Team
Objective: Automatically schedule a Google Calendar event for the assigned sales rep.

Implementation Steps:

Zapier Workflow:

Step 1: Trigger: Google Forms → New Response in Spreadsheet.
Step 2: Action: Use Google Calendar → Create Event.
Event Title: “Follow-Up with [Lead Name]”
Date: 1-2 days after form submission.
Description: Include lead details (e.g., email, company size, comments).
Assign the event to the sales rep’s calendar.
Enhancements:

Include time zones from the lead’s data to schedule reminders at optimal times for both parties.
Add a buffer period (e.g., delay reminders for leads in nurturing campaigns).
Limitations:

Sales reps need to grant access to their Google Calendars.
Overlapping reminders could become an issue as the team scales.
Final Workflow in Zapier
Trigger: Google Forms → New Response in Spreadsheet.
Assign Sales Rep: Use Zapier Formatter with a Lookup Table to rotate sales reps.
Extract Keywords: Analyze the "Comments" field for lead categorization.
Schedule Follow-Up: Create a Google Calendar event for the assigned rep.
Update Sheets: Add all processed data to a Google Sheets file for tracking.
Deliverables
Explanations
Lead Distribution: Sales reps are assigned evenly through a round-robin system. This ensures no rep is overloaded and all leads are promptly attended.
Keyword Extraction: Automates lead categorization, helping the sales team prioritize leads based on their expressed needs.
Follow-Up System: Guarantees timely follow-ups, improving response rates and lead engagement.
Limitations
Free Zapier plans are limited to a certain number of Zaps and actions per month.
The basic keyword extraction might miss nuanced lead requirements.
