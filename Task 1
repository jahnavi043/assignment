2. Workflow Implementation
Step 1: Trigger - Form Submission
Use Google Forms to capture lead details.
Configure Zapier to trigger whenever a new response is submitted to the linked Google Sheets.
Step 2: Calculate Lead Score
Use Zapier’s Formatter:
Add a “Numbers” step to calculate the score based on the form responses.
Example:
If "Company Size" is 51-200 employees → Add 20 points.
If "Annual Budget" is $50,001-$100,000 → Add 25 points.
The score is dynamically calculated.
Step 3: Add Data to Google Sheets
Create a Google Sheets file with the following columns:
Lead Name, Email, Company Size, Budget, Industry, Urgency, and Lead Score.
Zapier adds a new row with the form data and calculated score.
Step 4: Filter and Take Action
Filter for High-Priority Leads (Score ≥ 70):

Send a welcome email using Gmail.
Use a standard template like:
Hi [Name],
Thank you for your interest in TechNova! Our team is excited to discuss how we can help. Let us know if you'd like to set up a meeting.

Add these leads to the "High-Priority Leads" spreadsheet for immediate follow-up by the sales team.
For Low-Priority Leads (Score < 70):

Add their information to a separate “Nurturing” spreadsheet.
Plan follow-up email campaigns using tools like Mailchimp or manual outreach later.
